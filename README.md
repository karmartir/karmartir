⚡ Fun fact: I started my career as a graphic designer, creating engaging visuals and designs that connected with people. Over the years, I grew into a Senior Graphic Designer role at a reputable company in the US, honing my skills in UI/UX and digital design.  
Curious about how websites and applications are built, I decided to dive into Full-Stack Development. Learning modern JavaScript frameworks, building responsive interfaces, and developing backend systems quickly became a passion.  
Now, I combine my design expertise with development skills to create seamless, user-friendly web applications. I love bringing ideas to life online, optimizing performance, and crafting experiences that people enjoy using.
